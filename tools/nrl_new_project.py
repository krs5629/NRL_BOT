HexaSDK — Create a New Project
==============================

HexaSDK is the NRL Hexa Command Hub's WPILib-style project generator.

This script lives inside the NRL repo (which doubles as the bundled template).
It copies the template into a fresh, team-stamped project folder elsewhere on
disk so a student can start with a clean, build-ready copy.

What the team number does
-------------------------
NRL has no roboRIO-style deploy target. Instead the team number selects the
ESP-NOW radio channel (1-11) that BOTH the robot and controller firmware are
pinned to, so multiple kits in one room interfere less. The same channel is
stamped into both `platformio.ini` files as `-DNRL_WIFI_CHANNEL=<ch>`; the
firmware reads it (defaulting to channel 1 when unset). Robot and controller
must be flashed from the SAME generated project so their channels match.

Run it
------
Interactive (recommended):    py -3 tools/nrl_new_project.py
Or via VS Code:               Ctrl+Shift+P -> Tasks: Run Task -> "NRL: Create a New Project (HexaSDK)"
Non-interactive:              py -3 tools/nrl_new_project.py --name MyBot --team 7539 --dir C:\\Projects --yes

Requires Python 3.7+ (stdlib only). PlatformIO already ships a Python.

# re-flashed the same stale firmware every time, each with "Wrote ... bytes" and
# "Hash of data verified". The .a was 13 minutes newer than the firmware.elf
# supposedly built from it. Only `-t clean` broke it.
#
# Why this matters for students: a mid-season update replaces these archives. A
# student updating an EXISTING project -- which they will, since their opmodes
# live there -- would silently keep running the old firmware: no error, no
# warning, a successful-looking upload. They would report that the update did not
# work and it could not be diagnosed remotely.

# after updating" relies on memory in precisely the case where being wrong is
